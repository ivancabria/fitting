This code fits a set of points of the type (z,V), (x,y,V),
(x,y,z,V), (x,y,z,s,V), (x,y,z,s,t,V) or (x,y,z,s,t,u,V)
by means of the Linear Least Squares Method, to a fitting
function that consists on a linear combination of a set
of basis functions. V=V(z), V(x,y), V(x,y,z), V(x,y,z,s),
V(x,y,z,s,t) or V(x,y,z,s,t,u)

V is the function
x,y,z,s,t,u are the variables
